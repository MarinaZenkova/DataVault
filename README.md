# DataVault
Docker Compose to build a Data Vault + Star Schema + Information Mart from AdventureWorks.

To make it work just download the repo and run ```docker-compose up```.

```install.sql``` is executed while initializing the Docker container. The script creates a database AdventureWorks on PostgreSQL with all necessary schemas and tables.
